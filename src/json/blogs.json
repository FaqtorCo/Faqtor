This comprehensive guide examines seven technical advantages that explain Go's growing dominance in cloud computing and distributed systems. We'll analyze real world case studies from major tech companies and show you exactly when Golang should be your backend technology choice.",

Unlike traditional OS threads that require 1MB to 8MB memory each, goroutines start at just 2KB and can grow dynamically. This efficient concurrency model explains why companies like <a href=\"https://www.designgurus.io/answers/detail/what-language-is-netflix-coded-in\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a> use Go for their high throughput streaming infrastructure. A single Go program can easily manage 10,000 to 50,000 concurrent goroutines, while traditional thread based systems struggle beyond a few thousand threads. The built in channels implementation elegantly solves shared memory access problems that plague traditional multithreaded applications.",
