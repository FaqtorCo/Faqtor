You connect these nodes with lines that show how data flows between them. With 350+ pre-built integrations, you can connect everything from Google Workspace to your custom internal APIs.

It's open source, so you can see exactly how it works and modify it if needed. You can self-host it on your own infrastructure, keeping sensitive data under your control. Bill Gates once said that automation magnifies whatever operation you apply it to—efficient or inefficient.

Start with something simple maybe connecting a form to a Slack notification. The visual editor makes it obvious what's happening, and when you get stuck, the community forum is surprisingly helpful. As your confidence grows, you'll discover features like conditional branches, error handling, and scheduling that turn simple automations into robust business processes."
